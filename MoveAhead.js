DP you have to know how to deal with data in React and Redux.
You have to know how do we create actions,reducer and services.

Actions:
CRUD operations and types.
Actions: 
Action Types:
export const SET_FORM_DATA = 'SET_FORM_DATA';
export const CLEAR_FORM_DATA = 'CLEAR_FORM_DATA';
export const SET_SUCCESS_FORM_SUBMIT = 'SET_SUCCESS_FORM_SUBMIT';
export const CLEAR_SUCCESS_STATE = 'CLEAR_SUCCESS_STATE';


Steps to solve the problem right.

What my mind think....
If your are not become capable of it yet....

Way: 01
You mind wants domination or negative and thinks about success to show them how powerful you are...

Way: 02
As positive perceptive as I will have this, that people will know me how powerful i am, think about interviews after success.
Make more proud to yourself. I am this and I am that...
Mind always thinks about how to get achievement fast...
What are the steps to get things faster...
Mind doesnot wants to get busy on actions....

Be aware and watch the nature of your mind. How actually it works.

My be the options gets things not done in time, if you are dependent upon other you will kill your own strength and get things done by other.

Watch your mind....
Do things make little bit progrssive.

//React and Redux.
In class based components we are using componentDidMount, componentsDidUpdate, and componentWillMount.
Function hooks: {useEffect, useDispatch, useSelector}
In functional based component we are using useEffect hooks which is all the combination of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillMount.

useDispatch: sends our new state of task from our api and to our Store.

Acessing data in Redux...
The various option to fetch data redux-thunk and redux-sage..

Right way to learn the things: Do not see the videos and do copy their way of code.

Select the single project and do, you start to do......
While doing you have to know nothing about that just do and awake how the things are going. Do focus on that.

The way to clear any problem is work on that....
Mind seeks way to get things done......
